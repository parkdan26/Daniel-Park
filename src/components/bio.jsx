                    Hi, I'm Daniel Park, a second-year Computer Science student at Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario. 
                    I'm passionate about software engineering and web development, and I love creating innovative solutions to real-world problems.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    I have experience working with programming languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript, along with frameworks such as React and Tailwind CSS. Whether itâ€™s building a Resume Formatter, analyzing global socio-economic data with machine learning models, or developing Disaster-GPT for real-time disaster detection, I enjoy taking on projects that challenge me to think critically and solve complex problems.
